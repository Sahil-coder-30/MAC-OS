 macOS Portfolio OS
A highly interactive, web-based operating system built to showcase my journey as a Full Stack Developer. This project mimics the macOS Monterey/Ventura interface, featuring draggable windows, functional apps, and a responsive glassmorphism design.

🚀 Overview
This isn't just a static website; it's a simulated environment. The goal was to push the boundaries of frontend engineering by managing complex states (z-index layering, window minimization) and high-performance animations.

Key Features:

Window Management: Real-time dragging and layering system using custom hooks.

Dynamic Dock: An interactive dock with magnification effects powered by GSAP.

Functional Apps:

Terminal: A custom-built CLI to view my technical stack.

Safari: A browser window displaying my live web projects.

Notes: My resume and "About Me" section formatted as system notes.

Finder: A file explorer to navigate through my GitHub repositories.

Dark/Light Mode: Full system appearance toggle via the Control Center.

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (Hooks & Context API for state management)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Glassmorphism, Backdrop filters)

Animations: GSAP (Dock magnification & window transitions)

Icons: FontAwesome / Custom SVG icons

Deployment: Vercel / Netlify
